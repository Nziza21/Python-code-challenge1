# Toy Problems

This project contains solutions to three coding challenges in Python. Each challenge focuses on different aspects of problem-solving and Python programming.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time

Given a 12-hour time in the format "hour:minute period," the task is to convert it to a 24-hour time format. For example, "8:30 am" should be converted to "0830," and "8:30 pm" should be converted to "2030."

### Challenge 2: Two numbers are positive.

Write a function that takes three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as arguments and returns `True` if exactly two of the three integers are positive numbers (greater than zero), and `False` otherwise.

### Challenge 3: Consonant value

Given a lowercase string with alphabetic characters only and no spaces, return the highest value of consonant substrings. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou." Each consonant is assigned a value: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, ..., z = 26.

## Repository Structure

The project is organized into folders, with each folder corresponding to a specific challenge. Here's the directory structure:

```plaintext
toy-problems/
├── challenge1/
│   ├── challenge1.py
│   └── README.md
├── challenge2/
│   ├── challenge2.py
│   └── README.md
├── challenge3/
│   ├── challenge3.py
│   └── README.md
└── README.md
Usage
To use the solutions, simply navigate to each challenge folder and explore the Python files containing the solutions. Additionally, each challenge folder includes a README file with detailed explanations, examples, and function signatures.
